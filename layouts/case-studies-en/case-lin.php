				<h4>General description</h4>


				<div class="text-left">

					<p>Lin's store has been for years offering a wide range of various products at its shops. Their previous web store entitled "svezakucuidom.com" was outdated both by design and functionality. The company was looking for a new and fresh appearance, new functions and a responsive site, so as to improve the experience of existing and new customers alike. The old system could not follow their newly developed needs and the company decided to redesign the site and adopt a safer and better system, able to be developed while running. This is why we suggested the Magento CE system, widely used and with good results.</p>
					<p>At the start we encountered numerous challenges, such as „scattered“ existing bases for over 50 000 products, divided into 450 categories. In transferring the old bases into the new system we have reorganised categories and meaningfully reduced the number of categories by ~ 50.</p>
					<p>The new system was also supposed to enable easier new product entry, multicategorising the products, simplification of the overall process, from ordering to selling, both at the site for the use of the customers and for the administration in the system.</p>
					<p>Magento CE enabled us, with slight modifications and additions, to achieve these goals. Besides conventional functions, we also added fiscalisation, constructed special modules for the purpose of presenting particular product groups (for example, modules for the newest and best-sell products), and installed the WSPaypaymentgateway. An important item was also updating the amount of the product on store and their prices, for which we constructed a special module where the administrator could easily update both sets of data.</p>

				<h4>Responsive design</h4>

				<p>It was not easy to develop a mobile application for a web shop with over 50 000 articles. We had to adjust the system and enable the user to get a simple and intuitive presentation of the articles, offer connecting onto the system, overview of the shopping basket and articles to be compared and, the most important, to design the ordering procedure. We decided to adopt the approach of fixed navigation, so as to enable the customer to approach all the categories at every moment, as well as to approach the key elements, such as shopping basket overview, profile view, articles for comparison and the ability to register with the system.</p>
				<p>Mobile presentation "hides" all the secondary actions that could divert the attention of the customer in reviewing the articles. However, they can be seen by a simple click on particular elements, such as product filters. Employing this approach, the user can search through the article without any disturbance, and call for the filters, sorting etc. when needed.</p>
				<p>Ordering process is simplified to be adapted to the smaller user area available on mobile devices.</p>

				<h4>Adapting the display to the order</h4>

				<p>Administrator’s part of the system for displaying the orders is a big table with a lot of data. We adjusted the display, on our customer's request, and constructed a new display of the orders, with special data included and, to make processing easier, with background colours which indicate the actual state of the order.</p>
				<p>Our customer expressed the need to get a quick overview of the number of orders and to be able to copy the order, and we enabled him to achieve it by a single click of the mouse.</p>

				<h4>Adapting product display</h4>
				<p>
					As the amount of the orders was quite impressive, and they were supposed to be processed in a short span of time, our customer had a need to see only particular fields in his product display at any moment. We adjusted product display so that it now presents only those information that are crucial to the customer, as well as the picture of the product concerned.

				<h4>Fiscalisation</h4>
				<p>
					We were obliged to implement fiscalisation into the Magento, due to recent changes in legal regulation, which ask that all the payments by credit cards should be treated as cash payment, and to be fiscalised because of this. Fortunately, our colleagues in Incho previously constructed a free version of Magento module for fiscalisation so we did not need to start from the beginning. As a number of new versions of Magenta were launched from the moment when the above module was constructed, we had to make some adjustments and additions to be able to implement it. As FINA (Financial agency) expects bills to be in minus at fiscalisation when they are cancelled, we had to adjust the creditmemo system in Magento itself.

				<h4>Online payment</h4>
				<p>
					We selected the WsPaypaymentgateway system for credit-card payments, as it was the most favourable, they had a top-quality system, easy to implement and we have also been their partner-company. Apart from credit-card payments, we also had to implement the PayPal payment. This is, in principle, not a problem, as Magento has a previously implemented PayPal payment ability. However, situation in Croatia is a little bit different. PayPal does not recognise Croatian currency as a means of payment and it was thus necessary to include the option of converting kunas into Euros in sending the price to PayPal.
