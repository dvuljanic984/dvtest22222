				<h4>General description</h4>

				<div class="text-left">

					<p>It was, definitely, quite a special project. Apart from the fact that we had to develop a functional site on a short notice, in just a month and a half, it was also our first international project. The task was to develop a site which would help the organisation to find necessary volunteers, as well as to enable communication among volunteers. The most serious challenge at the beginning was to find the way to realise a permanent communications with customer and decide which tools could be used for the purpose. To achieve communication in design creation, we selected the cloud solution UXPin. UXPin enabled us to get a continuous feedback from our customer and helped us to complete the design in a short time period we had at our disposal, which made the customer highly happy and satisfied, despite the fact that we were 700 km apart.</p>
					<p>Besides design and communications, the challenge facing us was also to programme all the functions and possibilities of the site in a short time, as well as to test it prior to production. The site also had to contain a component for browsing and for updating educational programmes, as well as all of its details. The biggest component of the site is connected with data basis of the volunteers. We had to develop an administrator's part to update it, together with the front part that the volunteers could use to communicate among themselves, with the organisations searching for the volunteers and channels to communicate with these organisations.</p>

				<h4>RESPONSIVE DESIGN</h4>

				<p>In preparing and developing the design we kept in mind the fact that the site should be able to adapt to any device. This is why we used the „Mobile First“ approach in site development. This is a development technique where primary focus is small screen (most often cellphone) and contents are step by step adjusted to bigger screens.</p>
				<p>The main menu on „Mobile version“ is hidden and is activated using the well known "hamburger menu" icon (☰). Page header includes the menu icon, while logo and browsing can be seen on the mobile display when the user starts returning towards the page top. Header is thus not in the way and does not occupy precious space on the device with small screens (mostly cellphones) offering the user at the same time the possibility to open the menu or browsing in a quick and easy way.</p>
				<p>Due to the type of the project in question, most of the data were shown in a table form, which presented a problem. Having in mind our experience from the previous projects, feedback information and consultations with our customer, we decided to leave the tables in their full width and not to rearrange them vertically. We also installed indicators that showed the user how to review all the data in the table, not seen at the moment, by simply moving his finger left/right on the screen.</p>

				<h4>EDUCATIONAL APPLICATION</h4>
				<p>
					We developed a Joomla component, enabling the entry of the educational programmed through site administration, as well as the print of these programmes on the site. Visitors can also leave commentaries on the educational programme and apply to it. As this is a data basis of educational programmes, we also had to develop a module able to browse the programmes according to particular parameters.				</p>

				<h4>VOLUNTEER APPLICATION</h4>
				<p>
					We developed a Joomla component for three types of users, meaning different groups of users can see different parts of the component. The administrator can see everything and can enter and update volunteer data basis through site administration. The organisations and volunteers can access the other part, again protected by a login. The organisation can browse volunteers, see their profiles and communicate with them, while volunteers are able complement and change their profiles.				</p>
