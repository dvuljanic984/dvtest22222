				<h4>General description</h4>

				<div class="text-left">
					<p>This project was a real challenge. Even after the first technical meeting it was quite evident what direction we were going to take and we got green light to use modern technologies. Our task was to make something that would be a just „Wow“.</p>

					<p>We first filled in our drawing board with everything we had in mind, drawing and blotting schemes and good ideas. At the end we decided to do a double-sided design. Two designers were included, with two unique designs, both for a single project.</p>
					<p>After a week of work and a bunch of internal ideas we were faced with two design proposals, which we decided to present to our customer. The customer liked both designs, each of them had something special and attractive, so we decided, with the approval of our customers, to take the best from both proposals and construct a third design. Finally, the customer was sincerely satisfied and his comment was: „This is it! Good job!"</p>
					<p>In developing the site we implemented modern technologies, such that mark the future in the business. All the graphic presentations and icons were SVG, so as to make site loading faster and to enable animations.</p>
					<p>Apart from design, quite a challenge was to construct a top-quality user interface to be used to administer the whole data basis for all the products that were supposed to be presented at the site.</p>

				<h4>Responsive web-site design </h4>

				<p>In preparing and completing the design we constantly had in mind the requirement for the site to be able to adapt to all devices. Aware of this, we used „Mobile First“ approach in developing the site. This is a development technique where primary focus is small screen (most often cellphone) and contents are step by step adjusted to bigger screens.</p>
				<p>Key challenge was to present a multitude of products with subcategories at a small screen. As the product photos were of very high quality, we decided to present a single product in a line on conventional small screens, while the number of products increased with the increased size of the screen.</p>
				<p>The main menu in the so called "mobile version“ is hidden and is activated by clicking the "hamburger menu" icon (☰). The items in the main menu that contain submenus are designated with a „+“ sign, so as to suggest to the user the position of a submenu.</p>

				<h4>ICON SET</h4>
				<p>
					We were not satisfied with the icons we had at our disposal at the internet, and our designer created his own icons, such that gave a special touch to the site. You can see the set of icons here ...

				<h4>PRODUCTS</h4>

				<p>We constructed the whole component to be used for the input of Aquestil assortment, with 7 categories and subcategories included. Each product is supposed to have all the multilingual descriptions, names, etc. It was not easy to construct the data basis for this component. Products from different categories differ, of course, but they are also quite similar sometimes, and it took us some time to find the best relationship of tables and fields, to optimise the basis maximally and again to make it maximally functional as well.</p>
				<p>We had to apply automatic picture processing in the component itself, as there were a huge number of products involved, and even more of their pictures (of which many were not optimised).</p>
				<p>Besides entering the products, we had to link them together, as some of them could be combined, e.g. showers and partitions.</p>

				<h4>DISTRIBUTORS</h4>


				<p>A component was developed to enable input and presentation of all Aquestil distributors at an interactive map. The administrator's part of the component offers adding new and deleting nonexistent distributors in a simple and quick way.</p>
				<p>The map has the ability of filtering by state and/or city. City filtering depends on the selected state, which makes using and filtering distributers easier.</p>
				<p>The component also includes the Google GeoCoding, so that it is not necessary to enter manually for each distributor geographic longitude and latitude to be presented at the map.</p>

				<h4>PRODUCT SEARCH</h4>


				<p>We developed a module for browsing the assortment by specific parameters. The module offers the possibility of browsing bathtubs and showers by shape, possibility of installation and dimensions.</p>
				<p>The module is constructed so that the selection of the first parameters reduces the number of possibilities of dimension automatically, which makes browsing more accurate and faster.</p>
