				<h4>YOUTH CENTER</h4>

				<div class="text-left">
					<p>The project we did for CarpeDiem (Association for the Promotion and Development of Creative and Special Potential for Children, Youth and Adults) was a source of great enjoyment for us, as it directly impacted the level of available information for our fellow citizens.</p>
					<p>We had general guidelines after 2 or 3 shorter meetings – the site should be of vivid colours, loaded with information, easily accessible and, what is the most important, responsive, as it was expected to be mostly approached by young people from their cellphones.</p>
					<p>Having this in mind, we agreed to develop the project as a double-sided one, with 2 designers, 2 drafts, 2 unique designs, in a single project and with a single happy customer. After the first interaction with the customer, we already had a solution that was accepted by both sides. We even had a nick-name for the design we both accepted, calling it a „forest“.</p>
					<p>We developed and perfected some details and functions in constant communication with our customer. Intensive testing of the site on various devices (yes, we even used some „ancient“ devices) resulted in relatively quick and successful completion of the project.</p>

				<h4>RESPONSIVE DESIGN</h4>

				<p>In preparing and developing the design we kept in mind the fact that the site should be able to adapt to any device. This is why we used the „Mobile First“ approach in site development. This is a development technique where primary focus is small screen (most often cellphone) and contents are step by step adjusted to bigger screens.</p>
				<p>The menu is hidden to save the precious space and is activated by a "hamburger menu" icon (☰). To use the area optimally we also decided to remove the pictures when viewing the news on the home page.</p>
				<p>Calendar of events was a challenge, due to the amount of the information presented. The filters are hidden in the menu and called by selecting the option „Filters“, while the presentation of the events is always turned to the present day. We have also left small parts of the previous and next day, just to stimulate the user to „swipe“ and show him that he can scroll the days by simply moving the finger left/right on the screen. If the user notices this function, there are arrows provided to scroll left/right, so no mistake is possible.</p>

				<h4>EVENTS COMPONENT</h4>
				<p>Events component was designed following the customer’s instructions when Jooma CMS conventional abilities were not enough. The component is able to create an „event“, containing the name, beginning time, ending time, location with an interactive map that can lead you to the location, description, generation of links to social networks (facebook, twitter, google+), as well as the data on the organiser. The component also has a built-in ability to generate a link where you can get the iCal format. It also possesses the option of repeating particular events in certain intervals, which makes it highly useful, especially when an event is repeated weekly or monthly.</p>

				<h4>COMPONENT FOR EVENT APPLICATION</h4>
				<p>This component is directly connected to the events component. When the user applies for the event, the administrator has all the necessary information to be able to announce the event at the site and can do it by a single click. Of course he is also in the position to edit the application if some information is missing or if he wants to change anything. This component is of great help as the users can report the event about which the administrators are not perhaps aware. All of this makes the site highly useful and attracts visits.
