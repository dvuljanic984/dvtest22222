				<p>Regardless of the size of the project involved, the drawing board is the place where everything starts. This is the place of brain storming, first drafts are made here, problems solved and further steps defined. Anyhow, it is unavoidable part of our office and each and every project. When board is concerned, the only question is whether or not to buy a bigger one. :)</p>

					From a draft to the product
				</h3>

				<p>No matter which of our product is concerned, whether it is a web site, a web application, an internet shop or a mobile application, and they are all our products, the process of construction is quite similar.</p>
				<p>After we get necessary graphic materials from you, e.g. logo, colours, some pictures, after you define your instructions and wishes, we start with the development of preliminary design. We first make drafts and have our internal discussions on the topes of UX (user experience).</p>
				<p>When we select internally a particular preliminary design, our designer start building design for your web site, mobile or web application.</p>
				<p>While designers conceive and draw design, with an explicit instruction that the result should be as authentic as possible, their colleagues backenddevelopers construct the basic elements of the future product.</p>
				<p>When a particular part of the design has been ready for presentation, we arrange a meeting with our customer and present the design for the future product. We are quite sure of the quality of our work and have no doubt as to whether you would accept our suggestions. However, we are always open to further improvement and more detailed arrangement.</p>
				<p>After accepting the design, our system engineers create a test environment (an internet address available to you), where our backenddevelopers continue to work on the bases of the future product, services and additions, while frontenddevelopers start programming the accepted design. Throughout the whole process of constructing your product, you have the access to the working version and can monitor product development, indicate the problems or mistakes you have noticed.</p>
				<p>When the development of your product is over, we inspect all the product segments together with you. If any mistake is noticed, we correct it on the shortest possible notice. After corrections and additional inspection we release it.</p>
				<p>Our aim is to make the whole process as transparent as possible, with as few unknown factors to you as possible. We sincerely hope we have raised your interest in our work and are free to call you to contact us though the engagement or contact forms.</p>
