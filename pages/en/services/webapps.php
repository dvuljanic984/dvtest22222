				<p>Web applications are programme solutions very much similar to standard windows, Linux or Mac programmes, but are approached through an Internet browser (Firefox, chrome, IE. etc.) and are situated on a web server. This is why web applications have become increasingly popular, as they are available from any computer worldwide, anywhere in the world. The examples are systems for ordering and paying goods and service, booking various services, document exchange, bookkeeping systems and the like.</p>
				<p>In the ruthlessly competitive world of today, every tool that can save time, meaning money, is useful and asked for.

					<li>safe and uninterrupted backup (safe backup copy with all the data at any moment).</li>
